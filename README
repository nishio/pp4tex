=============================
pp4tex - preprocessor for TeX
=============================

TeX already has own 'user definition' command, \newcommand and \renewcommand.
However it doesn't have several features in modern programming language.
- You must be aware the name already defined or not.
- It is a global variable. You must be aware your \renewcommand is safe or not.
- You can't use digits in the name of command.

So, I introduced nestable, lexical scope system on TeX


Quick Reference
---------------

% define \Z \mathbb{Z}
  simple macro

% define \E[1] \mathbb{E}[#1]
  with arguments

% push
  start new scope
% pop
  exit scope

% define \Foo:
  here is multiline macro
  push/pop, oneline define are available
% end
  end of multiline macro

% include filepath
  insert from file

Look sample/small.tex

Best Practice
-------------

1: To override existing word are usually BAD.
  for example:
    % define S \mat{\Sigma}
    % define \mu \vec{\mu}
  Rationale: you can't use original S and \mu in the namespace.
  Exception: if it is in very small scope and you are confident it doesn't harm, it's OK.
